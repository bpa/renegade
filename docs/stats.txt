First off, let's define some terms:
  AC - Armor Class.  This describes how difficult it is to hit you.
  With no armor, a level 1 character would have a default AC of 10.
  The lower the AC is, the more difficult it is to land a blow.

  THAC0 - "To Hit AC 0" This is a measure of how likely you are to
  land a blow.  Specifically, to hit an opponent with an AC of 0, you
  would need to roll your THAC0 or above on a d20.  The lower the
  THAC0 is, the more likely a blow is to hit.

  ArmorRating - A measure of the effectiveness of Armor.  Skin has
  an ArmorRating of 0.  Higher armor ratings are better.

Our beloved hero has 3 main stats, each of which start at 10 for a
1st level character, and increase as the character gains levels:

Agility:
  -to AC, First Strike.

Strength:
  +to hit, +to damage

Vitality:
  Max HP, HP Regeneration Rate

In addition to these, weapons and armor provide the following:

Weapon:
  Determine base hit damage

Armor:
  Lower AC (by ArmorRating value)

These 3 attributes and 2 item types determine all other calculated
attributs as follows:

AC = 20 - ArmorRating - Agility
THAC0 = 30 - Strength
Damage = Weapon_Base * (Strength/10)
FirstStrike = Agility + 1d20 
  (Attacks happen FirstStrike order, highest to lowest)
MaxHP = 2 * Vitality
Regen = 5% * MaxHP each regen phase.
