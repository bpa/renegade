Welcome to Renegade
===================

Currently, we have one playable game.  Its fairly simple, but is worth playing through once.

Purpose
-------

Developing is fun.  By far, the best way to learn is to do.  Don't expect great games from this project, but do expect that anyone participating is having fun and learning.

Concept
-------

Renegade is intended to be a somewhat generic game engine.  You can't truly be generic, so we have targeted the RPG genre.  The initial releases will all focus on the old style view from above.  A game editor will also be provided later to create your own games easily.

Implementation details
----------------------

<table>
  <tr>

    $ python renegade.py hacknslash
